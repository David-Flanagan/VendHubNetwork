# Referral System Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented a complete referral system for the VendHub Network platform, allowing customers to view machines where they are the referral user and earn commission on those machines.

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Database Schema Updates
- **Added referral fields** to `customer_machines` table:
  - `referral_user_id` (UUID) - References users table
  - `referral_commission_percent` (DECIMAL(5,2)) - Commission percentage for referral user
- **Created migration files**:
  - `add-referral-user-id.sql` - Added referral_user_id column
  - `add-approval-fields.sql` - Added referral_commission_percent column
  - `fix-customer-machines-schema.sql` - Comprehensive schema fix
  - `fix-referral-rls-policy.sql` - RLS policy for referral access

### 2. Row Level Security (RLS) Implementation
- **Identified and fixed RLS issue**: Customers couldn't view machines where they were referral users
- **Added new RLS policy**: `"Customers can view machines where they are referral user"`
- **Policy logic**: `FOR SELECT USING (referral_user_id = auth.uid())`
- **Result**: Customers can now access machines where they are the referral user

### 3. Frontend Implementation

#### Customer Dashboard - Machines Page
- **Added "My Referrals" tab** to customer machines dashboard
- **Implemented referral data loading** with proper error handling
- **Added empty state** for when no referral machines exist
- **Added info banner** explaining referral commission system

#### CustomerMachineCard Component
- **Enhanced to show referral commission** when user is the referral user
- **Added referral commission section** with proper styling
- **Fixed layout issues** with commission percentage display
- **Added useAuth hook** to get current user context
- **Conditional rendering**: Only shows referral info when `referral_user_id === user?.id`

### 4. Data Flow
```
Customer Dashboard → Machines Tab → My Referrals Tab
↓
Query customer_machines WHERE referral_user_id = current_user_id
↓
Display machines with referral commission information
```

### 5. UI/UX Improvements
- **Responsive design** for referral commission display
- **Clear visual hierarchy** with green accent colors for referral info
- **Proper spacing** between "Commission:" label and percentage value
- **Informative messaging** about commission eligibility

## Technical Details

### Database Queries
```sql
-- Query for referral machines
SELECT * FROM customer_machines 
WHERE referral_user_id = auth.uid()
```

### RLS Policies
```sql
-- Allow customers to view machines where they are referral user
CREATE POLICY "Customers can view machines where they are referral user" 
ON customer_machines FOR SELECT 
USING (referral_user_id = auth.uid());
```

### Component Structure
```typescript
// CustomerMachineCard.tsx
const { user } = useAuth()

// Conditional rendering for referral commission
{machine.referral_commission_percent && machine.referral_user_id === user?.id && (
  <div className="referral-commission-section">
    <span>Commission: {machine.referral_commission_percent}%</span>
  </div>
)}
```

## Files Modified/Created

### Database Migrations
- `add-referral-user-id.sql`
- `add-approval-fields.sql`
- `fix-customer-machines-schema.sql`
- `fix-referral-rls-policy.sql`

### Frontend Components
- `src/app/customers/dashboard/machines/page.tsx` - Added referrals tab
- `src/components/customers/CustomerMachineCard.tsx` - Added referral display
- `src/types/index.ts` - Updated CustomerMachine interface

## Testing Results
- ✅ RLS policy working correctly
- ✅ Referral machines displaying in dedicated tab
- ✅ Commission information showing properly
- ✅ Layout formatting fixed (no overlapping text)
- ✅ Conditional rendering working as expected

## Future Considerations
1. **Commission tracking**: Implement actual commission calculation and payment tracking
2. **Referral analytics**: Add reporting for referral performance
3. **Referral links**: Generate unique referral links for customers
4. **Commission tiers**: Implement different commission rates based on performance
5. **Notifications**: Alert customers when they earn commission

## Notes for Future AI Agents
- The referral system is fully functional and tested
- RLS policies are critical for proper access control
- Always check user context when displaying referral information
- Use conditional rendering to show referral data only to relevant users
- Layout spacing is important for commission percentage display
